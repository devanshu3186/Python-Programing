'''Type casting is the conversion of datatype of an variable into another, type casting are of two types-
1. Implicit type casing
2. Explicit type casting'''

# Data types in Python do not have the same order. Some data types are of higher order, while others are of lower order. 
# When performing operations on variables with different data types, Python automatically converts one variable's data type to the higher type. 
# This process is called implicit typecasting.

# Python converts a smaller data type to a higher data type to prevent data loss.


# The conversion of one data type to another, performed by a developer or manually as needed, is known as explicit type conversion.
# This can be done using Pythonâ€™s built-in type conversion functions, such as int(), float(), hex(), oct(), and str().
